## Transcript of the video

hello everyone and a warm welcome to one of our hicolaid how-to videos this is where we try to illustrate some of our how-to manuals with a short video explaining how things are done through that today we're going to be looking at how you can figure some of our custom properties right this is really really easy and it's something that you will want to do if you have a larger implementation of Accolade or have a complex data model and where you want to ensure some of the documentation requirements for your data models so how we're going to do that we're actually going to do that by configuring a number of very very simple Json documents right and I'll obviously have to do that for a specific data model and a specific plugin of a data model so I'm going to be working here today with a Json data model I've got a sample Json model Json data model right here very simple data model with only one test documentation test document in here and I'm going to try and configure these things over here right it's the properties pane of my data model now how am I going to do this well the first thing that I need to do is actually I need to set up the system in a certain way for this specifically Accolade when it's installed on the different platforms Windows Linux or or OS X has a particular installation directory and in that installation directory I will need to have the particular configuration files installed that's not the case by default if I look at this directory right now right this is the installation directory of hackerlade options Json on my Mac then you see that this directory is currently quite empty there's only one file there naming convention options and that's not what I need in order to configure these custom properties so the first thing I need to do here is from my Accolade Studio I need to go into my help menu item and then go into the plugin manager and the plugin manager is going to show me my plugins also the Json plugin here and it's going to actually show me here that there's a link that I can click where I can show the customization directory for this plugin right this is what I want to click right now when you do that when you click this link then what happens is you see that in the directory that I had open over here it has config it has added a subdirectory custom properties with a number of files in there that I can use to configure my custom properties right and this is what I needed I needed to have this starting point in order to configure the system the way I want you will see that over here there's a number of levels that I can configure right and I'm actually going to start with the entity level right The Entity level configuration is where I'm going to start the customization I'm going to open up this Json file now what you see here in this Json file is first say about 130 lines that I have that are commented out right and that have a number of sample configurations for different property types right and and what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to edit it at this location over here obviously I've prepared this right and I'm going to open up a pre pre-prepared configuration right so I'll start with this one here right this one here is actually a configuration of a select box right where I'm going to select for a hypothetical insurance company what type of domain is going to be applicable for a particular entity so I'm copying this right I'm going back to my entity level config document and here and I'm going to save it right there in this location now I save this document this Json document and then I'm going to switch back to my Accolade studio right and I'm going to have to bounce this I'm going to have to restart the Accolade Studio let me do that right now so I've actually done that now and I've saved you the trouble of having to watch me bounce my Accolade installation but when I now go into my test document over here I see that there is a plugin right plug in a drop down that allows me to select you know the subject area of my particular entity that I'm watching right now I can actually go back to my uh document over here and add something else right I can add another property to the mix here right so I'm going to select these lines and I'm going to add those to my um document here right save that and again I will have to go back to my I will have to go back to my Accolade installation right here we go and I will have to bounce it but when I have done that when I have actually done the restart then you will see that the test documentation the test document over here not only has this selection box but also has a an indicator right there so that was super easy I've been able to um configure this very very easily using a very very simple edit in the Json document great now the next thing I'd like to do is to show you how you can actually go one step further and not just customize the properties of the entity which we've done here right but also make some customizations to how you uh how you edit the attributes of an entity so let's say that I add an attribute here which is going to be I don't know some kind of a test attribute right now I would like to edit the properties of this test attribute in a customized way how am I going to do that well I need to go back to my visual studio and I uh I'm going to edit a particular Json document that is related to a field level configuration of the um a field level configuration of the properties pane right so what you see here is another Json document and this Json document has a same structure lots of um uh you know um mock-up information here but here at the bottom there's a couple of really uh good parts that we need to edit in order to customize the field level properties now I'm going to uncomment this right and I'm going to add a new piece to this where I can actually say okay these these properties these attributes of my data model are going to be very specific and are going to be going to be going to be um uh having having to have some additional information with regards to gdpr classification and Source system information right so these two properties are going to have to be added at the um attribute level so now I've added this right and again same thing that I need to do I need to go back to my Accolade Studio I need to go and bounce this and now when I go and look at the properties of the entity I see these customizations over here but at the field level I also now have these customizations available gdpr classification and Source system name is now available there so again this is the second level of customization that you can do here by editing these Json documents now the last thing that I'd like to show you is how you can actually uh take it to a third level which is where you actually add some Properties or specific properties pain actually not at the entity level right which we've got still right here right there with the the drop down over here nor at the property level right we've got that right here but we're actually going to do it at the model level right so in order to do that I'm going to go into my visual studio and I'm going to open up a model level configuration right so that's uh it's a file that you find in the model level directory right model level configuration it's already open and what I need to do is I need to add a section over here right it's the same structure as the previous files right a bunch of commented information at the top and at the bottom here I'm going to be adding my specific uh configuration here now I've got that all prepared right there I'm copying this here right which is going to add a metadata tab right with a number of properties approved purpose archiving checkbox and a frequency checkbox that I'm going to be adding to the mix here right so how do I do that I copy that and I actually go in over here paste that over there make sure that it's properly structured seems like it save it and again now I'll all I have to do is go back into Hackley and bounce the application once we have done that we now see yes we've got the custom property at the document level at the uh property level but also at the model level right there right here's where I can add my approved purpose the archiving The Frequency I can edit all of these things as you would want great with that I think we've given you a little bit of an overview of how custom properties can be configured in hacker lead Studio I hope this was useful if you have any more questions please reach out and look forward to speaking to you someday soon have a wonderful day cheers
