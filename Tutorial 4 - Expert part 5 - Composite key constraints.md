## Unedited transcript of the video

welcome Accolade how-to video today we're going to be talking to you about how you can Define the composite key constraints inside the Accolade data modeling environment to do that we're going to start with taking a look at how you can create keys Keys primary keys inside your hackline environment well let's say that I have a table right here the membership period Well if I want to make the membership period ID the primary key of this table then all I need to do is to go into the properties Pane and check the checkbox that's all I need to do all you we will see right here that there's a visual indicator in the entity view the table view of this data model it says PK right there and you will also see that in the ddl script it has now been added right there is a new constant constraint right it's basically going to say that the membership period table has a membership period ID property that is going to be is primary key right that's as simple as it is but that's not really what we wanted to talk about today what we want to talking about today is to see how we can actually create a different type of key for this particular table which is not a single attribute primary key for this table but we want to create a composite key so with I'm going to deselect and undo the previous selection of the primary key now I don't have any anymore and I'm going to create a composite Key by selecting The Entity and then going back into the properties Pane and selecting the composite Keys tab in there here's where I can then say okay I have a combination of different properties that I can create a composite key with start with the musician ID property and additionally add the band ID property note that there's a sequence here and I am going to have to respect that sequence and and add that into my composite key definition you see now that I have again two properties two attributes two columns that are now marked as primary key for this particular table note that in the ddl script output I now have the I have a composite key constraint now that has the musician ID and the band ID specifically added note that these composite primary key constraints appear out of line in the ddl output right great now I have that how am I going to work with this and create foreign key relationships based on these composite keys right in a traditional foreign key I would just be able to drag and drop that from one to the other right from one property to the other but that's not what I want here right I want the both the composite composite key attributes to be included in the foreign key relationship constraint right so one of them now is I've created this foreign key relationship but I still need to manually go into the property pane here and add another parent Field Band ID as well as another child field the band ID right I also should update the cardinality here right so that it now properly represents how those two tables are linked to one another using composite foreign key relationships right I hope that's clear and you will also find again that the ddl script right has a specific out of line constraint added to the script which you can use in your forward engineering for example I hope this is clear I hope you have learned how you can create these composite key constraints in hackerlade and that this was useful for you and that you will enjoy watching this video and sharing it with whoever may find it interesting thank you for watching and have a great day
