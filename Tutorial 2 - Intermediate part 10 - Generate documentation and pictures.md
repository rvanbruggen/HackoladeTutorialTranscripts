## Transcript of the video

hello everyone and welcome to Part 10 of our hack related tutorial in this part we're going to be talking to you about how you can use Accolade to generate documentation and pictures straight from your data models right so this is important right because some of our artifacts are machine readable artifacts right so we've demonstrated that in the previous section of our tutorial here where we generate machine readable artifacts through forward engineering right but with our documentation generation capabilities we are going to be generating human readable artifacts right things that humans can understand and work with we offer support for three standard documentation generation formats HTML markdown and PDF the content of these three formats is identical but there are some differences they are structured in slightly different ways so here's how you should look at that the HTML is actually really interesting because it is a single file encapsulating all the content that you can immediately open up in into your browser without pulling in other resources or other images or something like that you know all of this is just baked into the HTML file and that also means that you can for example easily use this HTML file for publishing on some internal website on a SharePoint site or on Confluence jira site whatever it might be that you want to use you can just dump the HTML file in there and it will display correctly the second format is what we call markdown or what is known as markdown right which is super interesting for publishing on GitHub right you may know this already but GitHub has standard support for markdown for example all the readme files in your GitHub repos are formatted this way and that makes it very handy for publishing over there the pictures in the markdown format are placed in a subdirectory right which you can then also use to generate particular other types of websites you know applying your own style applying your own look and feel if you would want so to do that with custom website generators and in the last format is PDF you know also a single file format which is probably easier for printing and sharing with with some of your other stakeholders in every documentation generation capability there are going to be some parameters right which you will find in tools options and then documentation like for example one of the potential customizations that you can specify there is if you want to put a logo up there right or anything else you know what do you want to select what you want to include in your documentation generation right so this is an important part you know you will find that especially on larger models there's quite a bit of documentation being generated so you are very often going to look at Pages hundreds of pages of documentation which is not always necessary you might want to be a little bit more granular and divide the documentation up into multiple parts right and so you can do that by selecting the objects to be included and I would like to mention that all of this is completely automatable by using our command line interface right the CLI can generate documentation automatically for example overnight when it's run inside a Docker container based on the model files that you would give it there's also a possibility to print the graphic diagrams that you find in Accolade either two PDF files or PNG files and there's quite a few options there as well so let's show you this right so here I've got a reasonably simple database model for a mongodb database and of course you know I can start generating the documentation for it right and that means going into our menu over here and selecting the appropriate format right do you want do you want HTML what part of the model do you want to generate documentation for and once you submit that hackolate will will ask you where you want to generate this and then you you will basically basically say Okay I want to generate it over here right replacing that file it will take a few seconds and then you will open up that file in the browser here we go this is the file that I just generated the data model for Acme Corporation right the special logo that I put up there it has been generated from our data model I can do the same thing for PDF or for markdown right or I can also print these diagrams from this menu over here and then select you know what exactly is it that you want to print do you want to print to PDF do you want to generate something specific here and last but not least I'd like to highlight the different formats here right so we've got HTML we've got PDF right and then we've got markdown and markdown we haven't talked about yet or haven't shown you yet but here you go right this is the markdown format if you open that up you see that it's you know fully formed markdown but that all of the images have been put into this separate directory right so you can see how this is uh now also generated over here right the ER diagrams are put into separate files for your convenience that's it for now um I think you have got a great overview of what it is that we offer in terms of documentation generation capabilities I invite you to read up on some of the material that we post here the documentation the blog the book that we just published together with uh Daniel kupal and Steve hoberman and obviously all of the social media that we offer out there thank you for paying attention I wish you a wonderful rest of your day
