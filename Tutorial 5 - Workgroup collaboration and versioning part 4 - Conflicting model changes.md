## Transcript of the video

the next scenario scenario three is it going to be a little bit more complicated in the sense that what we're going to be doing is we're going to be introducing a small conflicting change to the data model so and we're going to resolve that using git so what we'll do here is in Clone one we will add a score to the movies entity right and commit that and push that back to the remote clone 2 will pull that into their clone right and then I'll make an update to that score property right to the description of that score right and in parallel in Clone one the work is continuing and is also making a update to the score description right clone one pushes that back to the remote that commits that and pushes that back to the remote while clone 2 is working with their uh updated uh score description in their clone over there so when they commit that and make something want to do an update right so they will need to First pull from the remote into the Clone right before they can push that back into the remote and that's when there will be a conflict because there's been an update over here to the score description and an update over there to the score description that we will need to resolve right so that's what we're doing so let's switch over here we are now looking at clone one and we're going to open up the model over here and in the movies entity we will add a new property score right and that's going to be a numeric value we will not yet add the description we'll do that a little bit later we'll save this and we will push that to the remote so adding score property to clone one right commit and push it back meaning that in Clone 2 we will now need to pull right because there's been an update to the remote now that we have done that and we can open it up here in the Clone 2. we will see that this score property is right there and I am going to edit the description that I have over here and say okay this is a description added to clone two and I will apply that I will save that to clone 2 right which means that in my git interface here adding the description right but I am not going to push that back yet I'm going to commit that only to my clone 2. right and then I'm going to switch to clone one and I'm going to grab the file and do something similar right I will add a description over here this is a description added from clone one right and I will save that as well now what I have here now is I have a different change to the same field in Clone 1 and in Clone 2 right and in Clone one I'm going to say well added the real description to clone one and I'm not just going to commit it I'm going to commit and push it so that means that now in Clone 1 and on the remote the central remote we now have this version here right from the Clone one version with this particular description right so this description over here right whereas in Clone 2 we currently have a different description right so if I now go to clone 2 is going to say well you still had a commit waiting but before you can push that you first have to pull when you pull there will be a conflict right because there have been two edits to exactly the same property right in the git repository so I first need to resolve that so it's going to show me okay what are the differences well it's all about the same property the score property in this repo over here in this clone over here we have this particular description in Clone two in this one over here we have the description from clone one so which one do I want right this one was the latest one right and this one was the one that I prefer so I'm going to check that solve it and now I will have to push this and so when I now open this up in Clone 2 you will see that the description is actually a description from clone one because that's the one that I kept when I did the conflict resolution right if I go and I go into clone one then it will say well you first need to pull right because clone 2 has actually just pushed its changes into the remote when I do so I now have the latest version in Clone one I open it up and I see that indeed the description added from clone 1 has so so to speak one and is now the one that is valid for everyone right so that's how that conflict resolution worked and with that we're going to wrap up this scenario three and looking forward to the next one
