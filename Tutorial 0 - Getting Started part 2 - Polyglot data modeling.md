## Transcript of the video

hello everyone and Welcome to our Hackley tutorial in today's session we're going to be talking about one of the particular introductory topics that I think are very useful for you to get started with hackerlade Studio specifically we'll be talking about our polyglot data modeling capability this is extensively documented on our website obviously there's some great articles here that you can take a look at but to give you a quick overview let's go through a couple of slides here polygon data modeling really originated in a discussion and a a lot of deep thought around how to deal with these different levels of data modeling that have been traditionally been used in the time where the relational databases still ruled the world right at that time we had these three levels we had conceptual logical and physical data modeling whereby the conceptual and logical levels were always supposed to be technology agnostic however The Logical level was always supposed to be a normalized data model which is in effect a contradiction why because obviously with the Advent of all of these new types of data data Technologies you really can't say that theological technology agnostic view of the world has to be normalized in a new polyglot persistence data architecture you will have lots of different parts to your application lots of different technologies will work together to compose one particular e-commerce platform for example in the 21st century you will have your inventory and your item pricing in the relational database you will have the shopping cart and session data in a key Value Store you will have your product catalog and your completed orders in a document store etc etc etc you can read it from the screen so obviously in this landscape it doesn't make sense to start normalizing everything at The Logical level we will have a need for a technology agnostic view of our data architecture that is independent of all of these different types of data stores on top of that we also know that you know every organization that develops these types of 21st century applications will want to have some kind of consistency across all of these types of data stores which means that they will have to make sure that you know everything evolves in lockstep at the same time and things don't break when the schemas Evolve therefore organizations are building pipelines right they are building structured ways of dealing with these different types of data architectures and therefore there is an increasing need to have a an overarching umbrella data model for all of your data components this is why Accolade has come up with a polyglot data model which is in effect you know somewhat similar to a logical data model but also similar to a physical data model and it even has some ideas and some concepts of a conceptual data model included in it a polyglot data model effectively sits across the boundary between logical and physical data models and we sometimes refer to it as a logical model on steroids you know it's a logical model with lots of additional functionality specifically a polyline data model allows for denormalization at this technology agnostic higher level of data modeling and it allows for complex data types things like nested structures for example and in effect it will represent a common physical model that will allow you to generate schemas you know technical artifacts for a variety of different Technologies with automated mapping between all the different data types of the respective Target Technologies it also has a lot of functionality that allows you to reuse and leverage a library of canonical objects for your domains so that you can use them consistently across all of your physical data models just so everyone understands a polyglot data model is an umbrella data model that sits across all of these underlying physical data models right so there's a master data model at the top or multiple Master data models at the top that are driving the underlying physical data models that are specific to a particular Target technology I think this is a helpful picture it's a helpful picture because it shows you how you can have multiple called polyglot models right a polylot one data model with the blue rectangles a polyglot 2 data model with the red circles any polyglot 3 data model with the green triangles and what you can see at the bottom here is that as you actually derive Target models right so physical data models from these different polyglot models you can mix and match them you can draw E11 E1 2 and e13 from poly.1 but at the same Target a physical model include things like E21 and e23 right so you mix and match these things together you combine them as you see fit and you link these different data models together as you need them this is how you can maintain that governance and maintain that consistency across all of your different data models I mentioned earlier that there are some conceptual modeling Concepts in a poly.data model and that's specifically in what we call the graph view right when you work with a polyglot data model you will see that there are these graph representations of your data model where you can basically have a higher level representation of the entities and the relationships in a model delivered by this graph diagram with that we're going to wrap up this section in our Hackley tutorial I would love to refer you to a lot of reading material that we have available for you both online on our blog in the books multiple we have the mongodb data modeling and schema design book that Pascal DiMare co-authored but we have a bunch of other books that are already available on Amazon or forthcoming uh very very soon and I would love to see you on our socials on LinkedIn on Twitter and of course please download the hacker lead studio for free if you have any questions please reach out to us we're here to help and I wish you a very happy rest of your day thank you
