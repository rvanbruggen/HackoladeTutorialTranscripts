## Unedited transcript of the video

hello everyone and welcome to another episode of our hackerelate tutorial in this episode we're going to be talking to you about how you can use Hackley not just to model the data and create a structure for your data but also generate synthetic mock data for you this is something that can be really useful right and this is not just us saying this but we just know that during your development of your system as you go through the different iterations as you test the different scenarios the use cases and you demonstrate this back to your stakeholders it's really useful to have fake but representative data inside your data set right you don't want to be using the real identities of your data right you don't want to be using real privacy sensitive data for example but you want it to be representative right because that will allow you to explore the edge cases of your application figure out whether or not the model is actually representative of your use cases and avoid that you have to spend lots and lots of time creating this type of data manually because that can be really really difficult at scale right so what you're going to to do with Accolade is basically a two-step process right so first you're going to set it up you're going to set it up in your model right and for each of the attributes that you want to generate fake data for you're going to have to assign a what we call a faker function right a faker function leverages the power of a library that is really well known in the industry called faker.gs right which allows you to generate this fake representative data really really easily by assigning a function to the attribute for which you want to be generating that data right so for every one of these attributes in your data model you're going to have to create a function like that really really easy you can see some examples here on the slide and we'll go through some of them later on now the second step of course is that you generate the actual data right and you define the parameters for doing so as you start the um the generation process right there's a lot of examples here I highly recommend that you take a look at some of our documentation material right so on our website right but also it links to the faker documentation and API reference where for every one of these functions you can actually see okay well how will I be generating for example a full name for a person well it says over here that this is the function that you you would have to assign there's a couple of options that you can assign but when you include this faker.function.person.full name and then close the brackets you know like this exactly right then and you include that in your Hackley deployment you will actually be generating full names automatically and representatively using hackerlade so you will be able to preview those results we'll take a look at that a little bit later as well during the short demo and you can apply this not just to document data right so for example here for Json documents but you can also push these generated data elements into a database instance if appropriate like for example a mongodb instance in this particular case so why don't we take a look at that let's go and switch to our demo environment so I'll start by showing you how you can do this for a Json document model right so this is a document model a hacklight model for Json documents got two documents included here right persons and addresses right they have an ID first name last name address address Street building number zip city country and what you will see is that for each and every one of these attributes on the right hand side here I have assigned a faker function right so first name is faker.person.firstname and then open and close the brackets right for an um a city for example it's uh as you can see it's faker.location.city right so you can assign all of these functions you know in line with what you find here in the API right so for every one of these different data types you have a function right if you don't want to assign a phone number okay then you would assign a function something like that well but I've already done this here and now what we can do is we can generate some of these documents by going into our tools forward engineer Json documents right and then say well let's just create the address and the person documents and include let's say I don't know 25 right 25 documents um 25 instances in that document right so now I'm going to say submit right and it was going to ask me to choose where to store these right so I'll do this over there right and then it's going to start generating those documents for me and I should only take a couple of seconds and then I can go and open that document for you and take a look at that let's uh switch to that right now so here we have these documents that have been generated right so they're actually in this document this folder over here here's the address.json here's the person.json and here you see right so 25 examples of uh the street Murphy field building number zip code City Country you know all of these things have been generated same thing for the persons right you will see that there's real sounding first names and last names over here that have been generated using this Faker Library note that you can also access this functionality by just double clicking on the entity right and then that will open the Json preview and you will see that the faker function has also generated sample data over here same thing for the addresses right so if I go back and open the addresses right here and look at the preview you see that it has generated the appropriate fake data there as well great so that's one example the other example that I'd love to show you is how you can do something very similar not for documents but actually for databases instances right and for that I'm actually going to use a mongodb example right so I've got a mongodb instance running in in the cloud here this is mongodb compass and you will see here I've got a couple of databases here that are up and running but I'm going to create a new database a mock database right I'm going to create that very similarly to my previous example by saying okay I've got addresses and persons here right they've got streets and the faker functions are right there right so what I can do now is I can say okay why don't I generate this script right and include the sample data right and how many samples would I like well let's grab a hundred right 100 documents that I'm going to be generating and now I'm going to apply that script to my Atlas instance and you will say we see it's starting to generate the documents and they they will be uploaded to my um mongodb instance automatically as well right so now it's generating all the samples the address samples you can see the progress happening right there right now everything has been inserted right and so now when all of this is done I can switch to my compass data environment right and see that now you know there's a mock database that has been added there's addresses that have been added and you can see all the fake data over here right the person's same thing I can see all the fake data that has been added over here thanks to this process that we just went through in Hackley great so now let's go back to our slides and wrap up this tutorial because you know I hope this was a useful example of how you can use hackolate to generate a synthetic mock data for your data models please take a look at all of our documentation our blog to book uh everything that we publish on a regular basis I hope this was useful for you and I wish you a wonderful rest of your day
