## Transcript of the video

hello everyone and welcome to another Hackley video today is part two of our accolades tutorials that we're going to be uh presenting to you and this is actually a little bit of a fundamental uh uh part of our tutorial because it will be talking a lot about Json and Json schema this is important for many different reasons uh the first of which being that you know we are going to be doing a lot of Json data modeling whether it's uh as documents themselves or inside document databases but we'll also want to understand this very very clearly because this is the fundamental technology that we use also in Accolade you know there's a lot of work that we base ourselves on using Json technology so let's Dive Right In what is Json well we're not talking about a Greek hero we're talking about the JavaScript object notation right it's a it's a abbreviation obviously for a way to structure uh your data right so that you can exchange it easily with your different systems right so you you create documents Json documents that are easy for humans to read but at the same time also easy for machines to interpret right so it's a lightweight data interchange format right it's used in so many different places and it always comply is comprised of two structures right there's a collection of name value Pairs and then inside there's these ordered lists of values right so let's dive into that and and make sure that we understand this inside the Json document you will have something called an object an object is an unordered set of name value pairs right they start with a curly left brace and they end with a curly right brace right and then the names are always followed by columns and the name value pairs are separated by commas right so this is the highest level structure that you will find inside a Json document having said that inside those objects you can always find something called an array which is an ordered collection of values they start with a square left bracket and they end with a square right bracket right and values are ordered right but they are also separated by commas and here's the interesting part you know the values that you will find inside these objects or these arrays Can Be Strings right in double quotes they can be numbers they can be true or false or no but they can also be objects right so you can have these nested structures which is super super important right this is probably the most important part that you want to realize when you're starting to work with Json documents is this nesting of information right so keys are always strings right values must be valid Json data types we just went over those right and that means that you can have an infinite number of ways to organize these things thanks to the fact that these things are nested right so you can have these very very um complicated intricate structures if you so want it this is also why you know they've become very popular these document structures these Json structures they've been used in many different places not in the least inside databases document databases like mongodb and couchbase and you know to derived variance documentdb elasticsearch for example you know all of these types of data database Management systems are using Json documents inside them and they allow you to Leverage The flexibility of Json when you store data inside these databases right so it brings enormous flexibility and ease of use you know that's this is why these types of databases have become so important and so popular and essentially what they're doing inside these document structures is they are denormalizing the data right you're not normalizing the data and splitting everything up into different table structures like we used to do in relational databases know you're actually going to capture everything all the data that you need into a single document structure the huge advantage that comes with that is that you don't need to do joins anymore or at least not as often anymore right you can just put everything that you need for a particular transaction or a particular process inside the same document a process that document as a Unity of work as a particular type of information that you're going to use inside that process through and through maintain the Integrity of the transaction by maintaining the Integrity of that document right and avoid having to pull things from lots of different places and joining it all together right so this also means that you can be extremely flexible because not all of these documents have to have the same layout the same schema there is obviously a caveat right it's you have to be careful with this with great power comes great responsibility right so you need to be a little bit careful with this because obviously it has all kinds of consistency implications and you need to be careful with that but to give you an example of what that might look like right so if we think about an order or an ordering process right we on the left hand side see you know representation of such an order with you know order information customer information product information line items of that order payment information and all of that stuff all of these elements would historically or traditionally be stored inside different table structures right you want an order table a customer table a product table a payment type an order line you know all these different tables would be required to process this particular order which means you have to join all of these tables together obviously now let's think about how we might do that in a Json document structure well it just means that we bring everything together inside one document right and we will have indeed nested structures inside every inside the document that hold more information about each and every one of those entities the customer the line item the product you know it's it's all going to be nested inside one document right so we only need to process that one document now obviously then becomes the question you know what does that document look like what is the structure of that document and luckily Json provides you with some tools for this the most important tool that you want to be aware of is something called a Json schema right it allows you to annotate and validate Json documents right and it defines what that Json document should be structured like right it's actually written the schema itself is written in Json as well right so but it's going to Define what the document is is supposed to be looking like you know what information is supposed to be present and obviously there's tools out there that you can that you can leverage to verify whether a particular document adheres to that standard yes or no like a validator mongodb has a validator functionality that allows you to verify whether or not a document that you want to insert or update inside their database is actually going to adhere to a specified schema right really useful functionality and it's all standards based right we'll include some links on these slides obviously but it's it's a standard it's something that once it's defined everyone should be able to understand and hackerlade as well you know we support these standards we generate these Json schemas dynamically we know how to understand this schema syntax and we actually have some of these validation tools built into ours you know so it makes it really easy for you to create not only the documents but also the schema for the document a couple of things that I want to highlight before wrapping up this part of our tutorial look at how we can represent these documents right because nested structures obviously are not obviously are not always represented in the same way when we think about ER diagrams right so entity relationship diagrams tend to be we focused on normalized data structures which you see on the left hand side here where everything is split up across multiple entities whereas you know what you're going to be working with what you're going to be modeling is that document is a nested structure so what we have come up with and what we uniquely offer to our clients is the ability to keep these nestled structures together inside your entity relationship diagram as you can see on the right hand side here you can also look at this as a hierarchical structure obviously right we have lots of functionality and visualization possibilities to help you with that and you can you can explore that inside our tool and we allow you to also create models that encapsulate more than one document right and allow you to see and to visualize and to to at least at a modeling level understand the relationships between your documents right we link those documents using relationships that brings me to the end of this um part two of our tutorial um we've taken a big tour of what Json is and what Json schemas are um recommend the number of um reading materials here on this slide not in the least the new excellent book written by Daniel kupal Steve hoberman and our founder Pascal DiMare which is all about mongodb data modeling and schema design but which is very applicable to this topic of this tutorial I thank you for paying attention I thank you for following this tutorial and I wish you a wonderful rest of your day
