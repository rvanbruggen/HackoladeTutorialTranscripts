## Transcript of the video

hello everyone and welcome to part 7 of our Hackley tutorial in this part we're going to be talking about how you can add relationships to your data models we've covered a lot already but now we're going to be tackling into something that people may know from their previous experience with modeling tools because you know obviously in uh ER diagrams entity relationship diagrams we're used to having these types of relationships foreign key relationship lines between the entities right because usually they represent some kind of a constraint on an attribute that is part of a table right this is a normal thing for us ER diagrams would contain relationship lines obviously this is much less obvious for non-relational databases or documents or schemas or you know files that we are that we are dealing with in our modeling environment because you know there really isn't necessarily something that would enforce these relationships if you're treating two different files who obviously have a relationship between them but that doesn't mean that they are going to be enforced right so having said that the approach that Hackley has taken to this problem is that we do still want to add these types of relationships in our documentation in our models in spite of the fact that there's no enforcement because it makes the model so much easier to understand document and maintain right that's obvious in our opinion right you want to document these types of links between what could be physically disconnected entities right in your data model so to represent that they are in fact linked to each other right so in uh accolades in the Highlight Studio you will be able to create foreign key relationships right which we know but we're also going to allow you to creates a different type of relationship which we call a foreign Master relationship why because in a denormalized nosql environment it's very common for information to be repeated to be stored twice right and you want to be able to see where that information is coming from not just the keys right but also the masters of particular pieces of information that is being duplicated right so we're introducing a second type of relationships in our modeling environment when you create a relationship in hacker lead Studio you will find that they appear at the data model level so at the very highest level of your modeling environment this is because there are targets out there physical targets out there that allow you to create relationships between physically separate databases and data models right you can basically cut across these types of models now uh when we talk about how you would go about these creating these relationships well there's so many different ways and everyone will have their particular preference right and I'll show you a couple of them uh in a little demo a little bit in a little bit you can drag and drop you know in the entity relationship diagram from the child to the parent attribute of uh compatible data types right so the child will then be dropped onto the parent attribute you can also go to menu actions and then add a relationship you can use a toolbar you can right click and then add a relationship in the context menu of the object browser or you can go to the relationship properties Pane and press the plus sign there there's lots of different ways as you can tell and it will be up to you to judge which one is most appropriate for you which one you like best another important Point obviously is that you can adjust the style of the relationship right so styling is obviously an important piece of a graphical tool set you will find that it's very easy to adjust things like thickness and color of every single relationship line but also and this is quite a recent feature for hackerlade you can position the relationship you can draw you can drag and drop it somewhere and it will basically be drawn in a different way from a different point to a different point so that you can customize the layout of your graphics and finally I also want to add that the relationship capability also applies to what we call compound keys so keys that that relate to multiple attributes on each side of the relationship but of course you will still need to be able to make sure that these data types are compatible and that you can link them from one to the other great with that I am going to first now show you a couple of things and then we'll wrap up this little tutorial here so what we have here is a very simple data model a container with two little entities in here orders and products products can appear on orders as you can see right and so there's multiple products that can be on one order obviously so my preferred way of creating a relationship between these two entities is by dragging and dropping from the child over here to the parent right so I'm just going to create it like that and then I'm going to say okay the parent field there's one product that can be zero to end times on the um on the child on the order right now what we have here is a foreign key relationship as you can tell over here right and I can also adjust the positioning of these relationships right so I'm going to drag and drop this like this right so make it a little bit more visual but as you can tell there's other really interesting relationships here that should be documented like for example the SKU number right and that is then not a foreign key but a foreign Master relationship right remember for a master relationship is a relationship between two entities that is there only for documentation purposes I'm going to indicate the cardinality and make the adjustment in terms of the positioning here as well right and then I'm going to do the same thing for the description I'll do the same thing for the unit price right so then I need to obviously adjust that and say okay this is not a foreign key it's a forum Master uh let's move this thing around right so here we go and here we go this thing as well is not a foreign key it's a foreign master right and I will indicate the right cardinality here as well and drag it around as well right so just so that it appears a little bit more visually right so you can do this in multiple different ways right I've just dragged and dropped this from one entity to the other entity you can do the same thing by looking at the actions here and adding a relationship there or you can click on the container and add relationship that way all of this leads to the same results and with that we've already shown you a big part of how you create relationships in your ER diagrams obviously you can name these relationships right you can give them more uh understandable business name here and you can also look at their details you know uh in in the right pane over there now the last thing I'd like to show you in this little demo is that you can also create what we call composite key keys and composite relationships right so here you have the possibility to create composite keys right so if I would say you know these two things would want would need to become composite keys well then I can do that by clicking on the entity going to the composite key Tab and then saying okay this thing uh has more than one uh key for its uniqueness constraints or its primary key capabilities you can choose it that way great I've wrapped up the demonstration of this uh part seven of our hack related tutorial I hope this was useful for you and then you can also let us know if you have any additional questions thank you for listening and I wish you a wonderful rest of your day thank you
