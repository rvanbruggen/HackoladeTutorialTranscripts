## Unedited transcript of the video

the next scenario the next scenario that we'll be looking at is scenario four and scenario 4 is going to be a little bit of a bigger uh scenario we're going to split it up into two parts for a and 4 B because we want to get as close as possible to some real world scenarios that you might be experiencing in your environment so what we'll be doing in uh 4 a here scenario 4 a is we're going to make some large branch-based changes right so we'll use branches to make some changes to our data models in our repos um there's going to be two branches one for minor fixes and one for new features um and we're going to be resolving the parallel work and the conflicts that might uh occur there using pull requests right so we'll start from the main right and the main will get um copied into clone one and that's where we'll work on the minor fixes it will also get pulled into uh new features clone two and that's where we'll be adding you know larger new features obviously uh so let's take a look at that and start with clone one so we're in Clone one now and we'll open up the data model and in the data model what we're going to be doing is we're going to do something very simple We'll add a description to the movies uh collection over here right so here we go this is a description of the movies collection right and we'll apply that change and when we apply that change we'll save it in the local clone and um what we'll do next is we are going to commit this adding the description but instead of committing and pushing it to the main we're going to add it to the minor fixes Branch right so we need to create that Branch first and now I've have committed it there still need to push it there you see that the branch is now selected over there at the top right so now I have this um minor fix right the description to the collection added to the minor fixes Branch next we're going to be making a change to clone two right so in Clone two I'll open up the data model and the change that I'm going to be making here is a little bit more elaborate because I'm going to add a new feature by adding a new collection right and this is the animals collection right and the only thing that I'll add here for now is one attribute which is an object ID right which we will expand on a little bit later but for now we've just added this one thing to clone 2 save that locally and then go into my git um interface here and say that we are adding the animals but we're not adding it to the main we're creating a new Branch here and that branch is going to be the new features Branch right so again same thing I've created the branch I've committed the changes I just need to push it to that new features branch that I've selected here at the top so in parallel um the work on the minor fixes is going to continue right there's another fix coming over here uh which we will be implementing in uh clone one so we'll switch to clone one right open up the model over there and very simply what we're going to be doing here is we'll grab the description and we'll add a second line to it line of the description of the movies collection right so and again we will save that to our clone right and in my git interface here we're going to commit and push this not to the main but to the minor fixes Branch so adding a second line to the description is going to be committed and pushed to the minor fixes branch and in parallel right we are going to make some additional changes to the new features as well and we're going to be uh making uh another change there in Clone two so we'll switch to clone two right and grab the file open the model and uh now what we do here is we add another property that is the name which is a string you know I'm adding that to this uh collection for now as a simple edit saving that as well um uh committing and pushing that to the new features adding the name property committing and pushing it and um now we're in a situation where the minor fixes actually want to merge their changes into the main creating this new version over there right so that's what we'll do next so we'll go back to clone one and we'll do something that we haven't done yet which is we are going to open a pull request with a pull request what we're going to be doing is we're going to submit the changes that we've made in the minor fixes branch of Clone one we're going to um request that they be integrated in into the main branch of the repo uh so that means you know um can we please review the descriptions and add them right so that's how I do this I open the pull request right and you know because I am obviously allowed to review this myself I am able to merge this automatically into the main right so the minor fixes branch with those two edits to the description of the movies collection has now been merged into the main if I switch to the main here then obviously I first need to pull once I've done that right I should have the latest version of the model in the main now and that should mean that the latest version of the description is now part of the main as you can see over here great right so all of this has uh worked exactly as we had hoped it would and what we'll do next is we'll do two more changes in the different branches right so we'll do one more minor fix and another um uh new feature right over here um and we will see how this then evolves right so let's first go back to our uh clone two and in Clone two we're still in the new features Branch right we are going to make some more changes here right and we're adding um a property here to um the animals collection right so what we're going to be doing here is we're going to add the um movie ID uh which is a object ID We'll add that to this collection it's a little bit small and then what we'll also do is we'll create a relationship from the uh animals to the movies right with a particular cardinality right 0 to n right so there can be 0 to n animals in a movie and we will commit and push this right we'll save it first and then we will commit and push this to the new features completing the animals collection right commit and push this uh and then we'll switch back to our clone one and do one more minor change there let's open it up uh which is that we're going to add another line to the description right so now we're adding a third line to the description of the movies collection we will save this here in our clone one and we will commit and push this to the um uh we are going to commit and push this not to domain but to the minor fixes right so here here we go uh we are going to say um adding a third line to the description right commit and push it on minor fixes right so that's what we've done right now and then the the next thing that we will do is we are going to merge the minor fixes from clone one into the main using a pull request so how do we do that right we are going to say adding more meat to the Bone in the description of the movies collection right and we are going to open a pull request for that right so we have now done that um we need to update the branch right so because the the minor fixes is actually out of date with the main branch and then we can merge it in right so we've now merged this into the main branch and that also means that we will have to pull into the minor fixes Branch uh we can also go and take a look at what it now looks like in the main branch after pulling over there right you can see that the blue dots are constantly reminding us of what we need to do next right so if we now go into the main of Clone one right then we should have the three lines of the description over here right this has now been merged into the main all of that has uh worked exact as expected now the last thing that we'd like to do in this uh scenario 4 a is we are going to try and get the updates that we've made to the new features branch on clone 2 and merge that back into the main in order to do that we're first going to have to pull from the main and then resolve any potential conflicts and then merge everything into the main branch right so how do we do this we're going to go into clone two and in Clone two we are going to to create a poll request where we uh want to say that we are going to adding the animals feature to the main right we're going to open that pull request over there but again it's going to say well you first need to update and when we do that it will basically highlight hey there has been a conflict here so let's solve those conflicts right and um it's going to be have a a description of all the changes uh the merges the additions the modifications right everything is going to be here I'm going to solve all of those changes and then I'm going to merge that into the main right so when we do that we also need to go and Pull and then we are going to switch to the main also there we will need to do a pull and then if we then go and take a look at the resulting data model over here then we will see that we now have exactly the new features over there but we also have the minor fixes over there right so this has now been completely resolved in parallel exactly the way we want it to if I go into uh clone one and uh and do a pull there first as well because we've made a bunch of changes in Clone 2 then we go we're in the main branch we open up the model we will also there see that there's the new features over there and we also have the latest U description available to us there as well so great that was um scenario 4 a and uh we are going to continue with some more complex examples in a little bit with scenario 4p
