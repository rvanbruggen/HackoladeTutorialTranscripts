## Transcript of the video

hello everyone my name is Rick and I welcome you to this new video published by hackerlade which is going to be a series of videos that compose a tutorial to the Accolade studio and all the tools that you can use within that today is the first part of that tutorial and we're going to start at the basics we're going to start at the start which is you know what do we mean what is it when we talk about a data model well very simply put you know this is actually just a representation of how data is organized right when you store data in some kind of a system somewhere you're going to have to figure out how to sort it how to organize it and how all of the different concepts all of the different elements in that data structure are going to relate to each other right so in many ways what you see in a data model is just an explicit representation of the structure of your data why do we do this well there's lots of different reasons why you could do that but at the end of the day it's usually because we want to support the development of our it systems right and make sure that they're always built and managed and governed in the right way that means that we need to think about consistency that we need to think about compatibility and of course that we need to think about the quality of the data that we put into those systems so when we talk about a data model what we really are talking about is the description of a business or a business application right we're talking about how we're going to build that application what the blueprint of that application is going to look like right and this is useful as I said earlier not just because you know you can go back to that afterwards but also in during the process during the development of your systems it's going to help you evaluate your options there's always more than one way to do something right there's always more than one way to design an application and what the data model is going to help you with is to plan ahead right we really want to think things through before we hand it to the developer and get the system built because we know that if we don't do that it's going to lead to a lot of work afterwards it's going to lead to a lot of rework afterwards something that you will always find in a data model is something we call an ER diagram an entity relationship diagram this is something that many of us have encountered during over during our studies during our computer science studies right but it's a very simple way of understanding those systems right they're just a graphical representation of the entities right the things the the the the persons the artifacts the things that we work with in a system right their characteristics right their attributes you know their height their age their weight you know everything that you want to say about a particular entity and how these different entities are related to each other right a customer places an order right the order is paid with a payment type you know those types of things are related to each other so therefore in an entity relationship diagram we're going to represent this visually right it's a way of representing that information and that is something different from what we call a schema right a schema is something very very different you know whatever technology that you're going to be using right the schema is actually something very very technical it's something that is not intended for humans to consume it's actually intended for machines or software programs to consume right schemas are machine readable contracts between systems right so the graphical representations you know what we looked at over here this is for humans this is for our stakeholders our individuals that are going to be working with those systems this thing over here the schema you know you see it on the right hand side here is what we're going to be using in our systems this is what the machines what the software is going to be looking at in order to understand you know how is this data structured how is it modeled right and obviously there's a link between the graphical representation and the Machine readable schema obviously this is um one is related to the other right models right these graphical representations can actually generate these contracts these schemas right so there's a clear link between the two and obviously you will also see that in your Tooling in things like the Accolade Studio but we'll get back to that a little bit later right and for now let's talk about how you start a data model how do you begin data modeling well a very normal way to do this a very common way to do this is to think about your functional requirements what is this piece of software that we're building this system that we're building what is it going to do what are the services that it will provide right this is something that you'll ask your your end users you know what do you want kind of right you will ask them the specifications the requirements that they want in a functional way for the system to provide right obviously that's a difficult thing to do that's a difficult question to ask and therefore this activity this data modeling activity is usually something that you do iteratively you do it not just once you actually do it time and time again right you can't really model everything in one go right that would be terribly difficult you know if you ask any kind of a stakeholder to describe everything they want it will just lead to chaos it will to you know a big hairball of requirements so therefore what people recommend what we recommend is that you start with the Core Concepts the core purpose of the application right and then dive into this afterwards validate this afterwards as well right check back in with all the application stakeholders to verify if you've understood them correctly if these functional requirements actually match what they really need but what a data modeler will always be looking for is a couple of essential components they will be looking for the key entities in a particular system you know what are the things that you're working with what are the things that you are going to treat that you're going to modify that you're going to process in this application the attributes of those entities you know how do you describe them what are their traits right and of course how they link to one another the relationships between those entities a very common way to do this is to look at sentences that describe this system right and then to see okay can we just look at what the nouns are in this sentence no usually these nouns relate to entities can we look at the verbs in those sentences because very often they indicate some kind of an attribute of a of an entity right or they might say something about how it relates to another entity right so if you look at this example here a customer with a first name and a last name owns a vehicle vehicle the vehicle was registered on a given date and is manufactured by a make right if we pull this apart right and we look at all the nouns and the verbs and the uh that we have in this uh these adjectives as well you know that we have in in uh in this sentence and you will very quickly see that there's a couple of entities we're talking about a customer a vehicle and a make right and we are got a couple of relationships between those right the customer owns the vehicle the make manufactures the vehicle right we also know a couple of attributes we know the first name and the last name of these are attributes of the customer and then we also know that there's a registration date as an attribute of a vehicle so we've got a little bit of a start here we've got to start we've got the components of our data model traditionally when you look at relational database Management Systems right you would associate an entity right a customer a vehicle or a make with a physical table right a table in your relational database management system and your attributes would be columns in those tables right every instance of an entity would become a row in that table right and then we've got these foreign key relationships that link everything together right that say something about the customer that owns the vehicle the make that manufactures the vehicle you know we will do this using foreign key relationships it's a little bit different though in what we call nosql databases right because in those types of databases we use a concept called denormalization looking back to that it does have a number of consequences there's a couple more things that I would like to explain here about our data modeling activity the thing is there's multiple levels at which you can do this and traditionally there have been three there have been three levels the conceptual level right where we have a high level representation of the data right and we talk about entity names their relationships and some of their attributes right but nothing more detailed than that then we have the logical data model which provides more detail more detail about the relationships between the entities the primary Keys the foreign keys right so a little bit more detail and then last but not least we have the physical data model it really specifies how the data is going to be stored in a particular database of a particular type of a particular uh brand as well you know manufacturer right or any kind of other storage system that you're going to be using right so this is how we did it traditionally and in data modeling we always use something called normalization normalization is something that you know there's a lot of mathematical foundations to this right but it's basically going to help you structure the data in such a way that you don't have redundancy right so you store the data only once and you ensure consistency you always know that the data is consistent right they're always structured in the right way right so in a normalized database like for example a relational database management system right something like a SQL server or a postgres SQL or MySQL or Oracle or those types of things you know this is how we're going to structure the data and we're going to structure the data in tables with rows and columns right and of course because of this because of this role of normalization we would try to do that quite early on in the process you know once we've got the concepts defined the conceptual data model defined The Logical data model will usually already have normalization as part of it which makes it more complicated with newer types of data databases and data structures we know and love in the nosql world nosql leverages denormalization in function of its access patterns right so we're really looking at a different way of doing data modeling with the Advent of these new technologies these new nosql technologies and that's why there's a really interesting Synergy and match between the data modeling practices that we know and love and the data storage architecture called polyglot persistence polygon persistence is going to basically tell you that there's no necessary necessity to store all your data in one place you don't necessarily need to have one database for one application you could just as well have many different databases maybe not many but at least a few different databases that are the back end for one applications and also you know these databases could be of different types they could be optimized for different types of workloads and and queries right so one application might store its transactional data in a relational database would store its social network information in the graph database and would store unstructured data or less structured data in a document database right so the advantage of doing that of using this political persistence architecture obviously is the fact that you can have the best database for every type of data it will be so much more performance scalable and flexible because the database is optimized for its particular task right it can really simplify things in many ways as well having said that no such thing as a free lunch there are disadvantages right it introduces complexity in the applications data storage layer right and the complexity is obviously in the fact that you have all of these different different backends and you need to keep them up in sync right you need to have related data in every one of those systems right so it really requires careful planning and coordination it's not a free lunch when we do that however and more and more people seem to be implementing these types of architectures you know we do need to think about how we structure the data in each and every one of those back ends right which is why we think that there's a need for what we call polyglot data models we need more than just the individual physical data model we also need the logical and conceptual data model in some way but we're going to call this a polyglot data model that basically provides the umbrella architecture for all of the different systems Hollywood data models the way we Define them allow for denormalization if you want given the specific access pattern that you're going to use this particular backend that backend database form it will also allow you to derive different types of physical data models and schemas depending on the technology choice that you have made for that part of your application domain right so it will allow you to do that for a variety of different Target Technologies there's also a very clear link with something we call domain driven design or not just we call it that way it's an industry term domain driven design is a way to structure your applications and we can apply the um the patterns of domain driven design to data modeling why because there's a need to constrain the environment a little bit we really want you to make sure that your data models your polyglot data models don't become you know these huge structures that no one understands anymore so we want people to focus their attention on their specific domain on their core break down complex problems into smaller ones and use the data modeling artifacts as a communication tool right so that you can basically involve your stakeholders and talk to them and make sure that they understand that they're all aligned on the language that you use inside a new application development effort we want to keep things together that belong together and we want to reach that shared understanding right the collect the collaboration between the the domain experts and the technical staff and the Developers and no need to emphasize this more but it should be iterative it should be evolutionary right we continuously refine continuously refine our requirements so that rather than working with the top structure here you know where we used to have these three clear layers of conceptual logical and physical data models kind of aligned with our different waterfall development methodologies now we get into a domain driven approach to software development to data modeling as well where the domain driven data model will allow you to have a polyglot data architecture and a polyglot data model which can then drive the target specific data models underneath it this is um the end of the part one of our tutorial I hope this was useful there's a lot of reading material on our website and uh uh in some of our other videos I hope this was useful and I look forward to seeing you in part two very very soon have a wonderful day bye
