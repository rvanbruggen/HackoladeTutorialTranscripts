## Transcript of the video

so let's take a look at scenario two right very similar to scenario one we're going to make a small non-conflicting but also non-cosmetic change to the data model and we're going to be resolving those changes using git-based resolution techniques so let's take a look at that and here we are again we've got the hackerlade studio set up with the two clones right so what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be grabbing the data model that we have over here where we are actually going to be not just moving things around a little bit but we're actually going to add properties to two collections right so here we have the movies collection right and at the bottom of that movies collection I'm going to add a property and that property is going to be called score one right and it's going to be a numeric property right I'm going to add that to the data model right and I'm going to save this here now in my clone one exit from it and then go to my git screen here over here and I will see okay there's something new that I need to commit all right so added score one to the movies entity right but I'm going to commit that right but I'm not yet going to push it right similar to what we did before with the Cosmetic changes right I'm going to switch to clone 2. and in Clone 2 I'm going to do something similar right I'm going to open up the data model from clone 2 and you will see that the property has not been added here yet right and I'm going to add it over here as well right and I'm going to call it score 2 right because we're in Clone 2 now I'm going to make this numeric as well right I'm going to save it exit from the model go to my git screen and I am going to add this uh not just to my local clone but I'm also going to push it so adding score 2 to the movies entity and I'm going to commit and push that to the remote so now that is done right what I'll do next is I'll switch back to my clone one it still has my local commits waiting to be pushed but before I can do that I actually need to pull right I need to pull from the remote and here again there's going to be a conflict of course right because clone 2 had the addition of uh score 2 and I have a little button here that allows me to solve the conflicts right and what you will see here is that there's actually a comparison screen right where here we have score one added to the movies entity and here we've got score two added to the movies entity so what I can go and look at over here now is that there have been both of these added to this entity and then I can actually accept both of them to be added right and solve that right and solve for these elements to be added automatically to my um remote here so now that this has been done I can push this to the remote now right and now if I open this file again in Clone one I will see that I have both these scores over there right in Clone one if I go and I open it in Clone two right I here I still only have clone two I score two but what I obviously first need to do is I need to pull from the remote right and when I do that and then open it back up over here then we will see that both score one and score two are now part of my data model this may not be a 100 realistic scenario in many scenarios you would probably only keep one of those two scores right I can see how that would be the case but I wanted to illustrate how this conflict resolution through that comparison screen that we saw earlier is actually really really easy in the hangulate studio great with that we're going to wrap up this scenario too and get ready for the next scenario foreign
