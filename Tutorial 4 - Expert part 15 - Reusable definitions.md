## Transcript of the video

hello there and welcome to a new Accolade video in this video I'm going to show you how you can work with reusable definitions inside the Accolade studio in order to do that I'm going to work with a Json document data model which I've already created there's only one document in this model which is the document representing a person now in that person document you see that there is an address object right so this is a nested object inside the Json document that has a house number A Street a City a state and a zip right so what I want to do now is I want to convert this part of the Json document into something that we can reuse right because you know what there's other things that would have addresses as well right so let's do that why don't we go here and say okay I'm going to convert this to a model definition in order to do that I now I've just clicked there and as you can see here we now have a model definition over here right we have a little M signifying you know that this is actually a model definition and in the schema we have some internal definitions and we can actually see you know that this has been added to the person document specifically you can also see that over here at the bottom right where you have a model definition tab that has been added to the user interface now how would it work if you were to reuse this model definition with this address object in a second document to do that I'm going to switch to another data model where I've already prepared the skeleton of a company document that has been added here well what I'm going to do here now is I'm going to actually append an attribute from a reference that's a model definition that's an address right when I do that I now have the same model definition right the reusable object right I'm I've actually added this to both my person document and my company document you can see the definition is still there but there's only one definition and it's been added to both of my documents to prove that I can actually make some changes here all right I can go into the model definition over here and say well this ZIP code that I have over here that's not a number no it's actually going to be a string right and when I do that over here you now see that the string the ZIP code is also a string over there and over there right so updating it over here right from a string to a number again right will update it over there as well you can actually see this use of these model definitions at work by looking at my introspecting the definition of the Json that is Behind These individual documents right so if I now go here and I tap the Json preview then I can see here that the definition of the of the person documents right has these different properties but one of them is actually referencing a definition of an address over there if I here click the resolved drop down then I can actually see what it does right it pulls in the definition of these this address object right from the model definition right and same thing I can actually look at it in a different way by using as as an as an internal definition and look at the different representations over there right so this is really really easy there's some other fancy stuff that you can do here like for example you can see where the address definition that I have over here is actually being used in my data model simple in this case because we've only got two documents but if I've got a lot of these documents then this option where use is going to be super super interesting I click this and it immediately tells me that yes this address is being used inside the person document and it's also being used inside the company document I can go there immediately and then work with it from there on there's another thing that's really really interesting which is that obviously sometimes you might want to deviate from these reusable definitions right so for example let's say that in the case of a company address I need something else I need some different type of zip code for example well in this particular case what I'm going to do then is I'm going to say here that I'm going to replace these um model definition based attributes by actual implementations of them that are specific to this document replace them by by attributes and as a consequence now I only have this definition over here I can reuse in one place right so right now if I do rare use it's only going to be used in the person document as you can tell a last thing that I wanted to show you is the fact that these definitions here right which are now internal to my data model can actually also be sourced from external files right so let's say that I go back to my original state here where the company does not yet have an address and the person same thing does not yet have an address right I'm actually going to remove this model definition here as well right and I'm actually going to use an address structure definition that is stored in an external file and maintain the language through that file how do I do that well here we go right I'm going to append the attribute from a reference which is going to be external what I'm going to do now is I'm going to choose the definition then I want to reference in my model here and I'm going to point to a particular file like this one over here right and then I apply that and then I say okay what do you want to reuse well it's the actual this reusable address that I want to reuse I apply that and I include that right so here you now have an address object that is referencing an external file same thing here I want to append an attribute from a reference that is external right and now I'm going to grab that file over here apply it select the part that I need boom here we are right so now as a consequence both of these documents in my data model the person document and the company document are referencing an externally sourced address definition I hope that's clear and I hope that you really liked this video and it was useful for you please send us any comments that you might have and then we can follow up with you separately I wish you a wonderful day and I hope this was useful bye
