## Unedited transcript of the video

hello there and welcome to part four of our Accolade tutorial in this tutorial we're going to get our hands dirty and create a first data model this is after you've installed the software and after you have validated this software key obviously to create a new data model you can do it in different ways um we're going to start by clicking over here and then immediately you will see that there's a variety of different model types to choose from depending on the target physical targets that you want to be creating a model for right now in many many cases you could actually start creating this model by reverse engineering it from that particular Target but in this case we're going to start with a blank page and just select the particular Target that we want if you don't see the plugin of your choice in this particular dialog then you can always go over here and select the additional plugin for your particular Target and install it in your local local instance it could be that you have to restart your Accolade Studio but that is very quickly done and should not be a problem so let's start here and create a model which is a model for a Json document right so what we're going to do now is we're going to start working in this entity relationship diagram that we have over here and add a particular document this is going to be a document that is going to be about a person right so here in the properties pane I can indicate the name of this particular document then I'm going to right click and add another attribute for example here what I'm going to do is I'm going to say this is the first name of this particular person that's the first attribute that I'm going to be adding to the document and indeed that is going to be a string right now I'm going to also add another um property another attribute to this document by clicking this little button over here append field know that there are shortcuts keyboard shortcuts that you can use as well and this is going to be my last name property for this particular document and here I'm going to add another field here which is going to be the date of birth the dog right and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to say well hey this is indeed a string but the string is from is of a particular type it is a date string right because the date of birth is our particular kind I'm also going to add a description here dob stands for date of birth right and add that to my data model once I have that I can add a couple more properties here if I wanted to so for example what I'm going to do is I'm going to add another property that is the height of a particular person right and that is an integer indeed right I can add a lot of different constraints more descriptive properties I can add enumerations I mean Max values all these different things and I can also change the order of these particular properties very very easily by working with the capabilities of the ER diagram note that I also can go to the options pane here of my particular entity that I've added my particular document that I've added and for example change the color of the particular document that I'm working with really really easily in addition to the ERD view of this particular document that you have here you can also look at the schema view hierarchical schema view of this document this is really interesting because if you double click here or if you would for example right click here and and open it here um in a new tab right or if you would go back and uh for example um push the little icon here in the title then you see this hierarchical schema view of the document which is super interesting when you're dealing with um nested structures not really the case in this particular document right now but could be really interesting should you have these nested structures in your models in this particular hierarchical schema tab you also find a number of tabs at the bottom here which will allow you to do specific things for the document that you're looking at one of the more interesting tabs that you find at the bottom is what we call the Json preview tab right the Json preview type gives you two side-by-side panes one of them is for the Json schema of the particular entity and the other one is for a sample document a sample document of the structure that you are modeling right now there's a lot of different options that you can choose here you can look at the different capabilities here but obviously all of these have particular uses that will be more and or less useful in your specific environment once you are happy with the model you should obviously save it by clicking the little button over there or by doing a control s or command s depending on the platform and give the particular document model a name in a particular location tutorial right and then say well this is part four dot Json save it and now you are good to go there's also quite a few options that you can take a look at right so in the options menu of Accolade you will find that there are for example name for naming formats that you can choose but there's also other options that would be useful like for example the default paths that you might want to set especially if you're integrating with things like GitHub also one thing that might be important is that you have the possibility to have multiple Accolade documents open at the same time should you want that then you would actually want to create a new application instance right so let's leave this particular document model or open the Json document model open and then start a new application instance which will allow me to work on another model at the same time as finishing the original model that was working on there's also a number of other tips and tricks we will link to that from the tutorial page obviously but for now that concludes our part four and I welcome you to follow along in the next chapter of this tutorial thank you see you soon
