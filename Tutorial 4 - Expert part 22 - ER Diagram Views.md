## Transcript of the video

hello everyone and welcome to another hack late tutorial in this tutorial we're going to be talking to you about what we call ERD views entity relationship diagram views right and this is a topic that's actually really interesting it's a very short topic but what we'll talk about here is how you can actually use erdvs to make sure that specific parts of your model you know sometimes you have a really large model with lots and lots of entities and lots of relationships between those entities well how do you divide that up how do you split that up into things like what we sometimes call subject areas or domain diagrams right well erdvs are the tool to use for this what we're going to be doing is we're going to be selecting a subset of the entities of the main entity relationship diagram and split it up over multiple different ER diagram views so that you can better manage those really large models right so this will allow you to actually split up the model into domains right so by domain or by subject area is is really great for this idea around domain driven data modeling that we've been talking about quite a bit lately and you know this is one of the tools that you can use for this right entities can appear in multiple erdvs right also relationships right and you can make modifications in the erdvs and they are immediately reflected across your different parts of your model and you know wherever you edit it it will immediately be reflected in the UI another really cool feature is that you can actually configure different display options for every different erdv so you can have different ways of looking at that subject domain you can create an erdv from the actions menu from the toolbar or from the object browser browser but I'll show you this in a couple of seconds here and then of course you can always edit this right you can always edit how you can see which parts of your main ER diagram are part of specific domain specific ER the views right so let's Dive Right In and I'll show you a little bit of what this looks like so what I have here is you know a very modestly sized relational uh database diagram it's a postgres database and you can see here there's different entities right so this is the DVD rental data set that I've been using quite a few times uh well you've got the rentals over here you've got the staff you've got the inventory you've got the payments well the first thing we'll do here is we will select a few of these entities right so hold down your uh control key and select multiple of these entities and then basically say well let's add them to a diagram view right now I currently don't have any diagram views set up yet so I'll create a new one and you will see that here at the bottom of your object browser all of a sudden this is now appearing right I can play around with this I can also make some edit some edits here right so here I have this property called nickname in the staff entity well let me just remove that I'm removing it from the erdv that I've just created right and if I now switch back to the main ERD ve then you will see that in the staff entity over here there's no longer a nickname entity if I add it back here and I call it a fancy nickname right a new property that I've just added here and I switch back to the erdv and you will see that it is already there right so I can also um add another one I can add another erdv I'll go back into the DVD rental and I'll say Okay inventory rental and staff right so not the payment but the those here I'm going to add to an erdve right and I can create this inside the already existing new diagram view or I can create another one right which I'm going to give a name you know just to not be too confusing second new diagram view right and now you can see them appearing here right so I've got the new diagram view over here maybe I'll just rename that and say this is the first one right so I've got the first diagram review and I've got the second diagram View and as you can see here in the second diagram view I also have the nickname available but I can now say well you know what in this second diagram view I'd like to have a little bit of a different way of looking at things so let me just just get rid of all of those different attributes right and now switching between those diagram views and the main ER diagram you will see that they look quite different right I can also go and edit the membership of the diagram view right so if I go over here I can now say well in the schema over here right there's 15 tables with only three of them are in that second diagram view why don't why don't I add one here the country right and that will now also show up here and I can obviously restructure that so that it becomes a little bit more visible right so that's it that's the overview that I wanted to give you so with that I'm going to wrap up this tutorial and highlight a few more reading materials I've been highlighting these throughout our different tutorials some great documentation a great blog fantastic new book that is about mongodb data data modeling there's another one around neo4j data modeling and many of the concepts that you will find in there are applicable to lots of other domains as well with that I'm going to wrap up I'm going to wish you a wonderful rest of your day cheers
