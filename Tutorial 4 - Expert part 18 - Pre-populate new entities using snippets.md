## Transcript of the video

welcome to another recording of our Accolade how-to videos what I'm going to do today is I'm going to try and show you how you can create Snippets of data models that you can use to pre-populate new entities in your data models and be more productive as you create these data models in Accolade right to do that I'm actually going to create a new model here and I'm not going to use a Json model I'm just going to do something in mongodb today and I do want to make sure that everyone realizes that you should actually make sure that you do the first little update to your Accolade configuration files by accessing the plugin manager this is something that you have to do once it's automatic after that but over here all you need to do is click on this show plugin customization directory so that it can then pre-populate it with some file structures that you need in order to do the customization for the Snippets let me show you that it's very very easy this is the home directory of the Accolade installation if I go into the mongodb options directory right here now you see that there's actually a custom properties folder that has been pre-populated and this is the one that I want to use in order to create all of my customizations including the Snippets that we're going to be talking about today so what do I need to do well first of all I need to copy the Snippets in there right so I've actually got those Snippets over here I've got them uh pre-populated right so there's two Snippets one called canonical the other one called metadata this one is super simple the canonical uh snippet is super simple you know it basically adds a couple of nested properties into your data model this was a little bit more complicated it's a little richer you know it's got like a multiple properties schema version Source all of these different things right so I'm going to copy these two into my directory structure I've already done that and they're right there right so here I've got these two documents and there is essentially the same that ones that you see over here so what I need to do next is I need to activate these documents and how do I do that well over here in my properties pane directory I have a document called default data that document is empty right now and I'm going to be editing that document right so what I want to do now is I'm going to grab that document this is the one the empty document right there's nothing in here right I'm going to copy this little text here into that default data Json document right paste it over there and now what's going to be happening is as I open up a new entity in my mongodb document my model I'm going to get a pre-populated property added to that entity right so what I need to do next is I'm need to bounce my Accolade installation you know shut it down restart it and then I can show you this so I've just restarted hackerlade I'm going to be adding a new mongodb model right and now when I add a new collection here it actually pre-pay pre-populates that collection with the appropriate information as I specified it in the snippet let me save this one right and I'll just uh save it over here this is my mongodb model that's fine right but what I want to do now is I want to actually show you how you can have another snippet activated right which I have to do over here right um I activate one snippet at a time so here I'm going to say now the metadata snippet is going to be active right we have two Snippets in the appropriate directory but I've just switched to the other one now in order to activate it I actually need to shut down my Accolade again and restart it so let me do that so I've now restarted hackerlade I'm going to reopen the model and as we remember here I've now got the meta data snippet anchive right so when I activate a new collection I add a new connection to my model all of a sudden I have that snippet that has been activated you know it's the metadata one not the canonical one so with that I now have a really really productive way of kickstarting my model development using um Accolade Snippets and I'm going to wrap up this little video and wish you a wonderful rest of your day have a good one bye
