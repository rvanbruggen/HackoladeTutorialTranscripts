## Unedited transcript of the video

hello everyone and welcome to another episode of our Accolade tutorial in this episode we'll be talking about how you can use Accolade to suggest denormalized structures in a normalized data model this can be really useful right for example when you are contemplating to do some application modern modernization for example or when you are simply migrating data from a relational database management system to some kind of a nosql document database or a Json schema or whatever it might be right in that case you will be considering how you would design the um the data model for that new nosql storage format and you will probably be basing it on some kind of an access pattern right so we have a very good and separate tutorial and a separate article about this but you know you're going to do some modeling that is going to leverage the concepts and the structural denormalized data models in that new modernized environment so what we're going to show showing you here in this tutorial is that you can use a tool like the Hackley Studio to implement that denormalized structure right it's very important however that you realize that this is something that you should be thinking about up front you don't do this randomly you don't do this haphazardly you would do the denormalization in a very structured way based on the analysis of your access patterns right so what we'll be showing you a little bit later is a an example of the Northwind database you probably noticed from many demo databases that you've seen over the years where you have an orders table right with all the lists of the orders right row by row and then order details table where for every order ID you would have a reference to a product and a quantity of that order line as it would appear on the order specifically right so this is an example of a set of tables that contain a foreign key relationship and that you could potentially denormalize so therefore in the Accolade Studio we can help you do that normalized denormalization but you should really take care while doing so right so you do this two tables at a time you don't try to do more at the time right and then you have to specifically select you know what type of embedding you want to be using in your denormalization right so there's different ways that you can do this depending on the direction and the cardinality of your relationship right so in One Direction you might be able to say sub document in child in the other direction that would most likely then become array in parent right so um and you can also consider implementing both you know if you are implementing the extended reference pattern for example and you can obviously also edit this when necessary right and and uh and take it for a spin and see how that plays out right so um let's take a look at that right so in the One Direction right where you would be embedding an array in the parent right you can see on the left what the current structure is in the normalized data model and in the denormalized data model you would modify the orders um entity to have a an array of order details listed inside it right that's the resulting denormalization right in the other direction right if you would like to be embedding sub documents in a child then what happens is that in the order details collection or entity you would all of a sudden have a list of sub-documents where the products would be contained right so this is how the resulting denormalization would play out right so why don't we take a look at that and I'll switch to my Accolade environment now and show you how this is done so here we are we have the north wind data model right here the normalized version of it where we have the orders entity and the order details entity right and they're linked to each other through this relationship so what I'll do next is I'll go to my tools menu and say why don't we suggest the denormalization right and then I select the two entities involved I select two entities at a time right and I say okay why don't you do a sub document in child first or actually yeah let's do that right and when you do that you see that what is what has happened here right so let me restructure this a little bit right and show you how this is done right so now we have modified the order details uh table here and it now has this nested structure where the product details of the orders are included inside this entity right so that's one way of doing it but let's um undo this for now and go back to our original original structure right so this is what it used to look like at the beginning and now I'll do the other direction right and I'll basically do the denormalization the other direction um we can save this and we say okay why don't you do this right Harry in parent right and when you do that in my view this is actually a little bit more logical because then what you would have is over here in the orders entity you would have all the order details embedded inside that document right so that's really logical and two great examples of how you can use the Accolade Studio to suggest denormalization so let's wrap this up here and I would highly recommend that you would read up on this obviously you know documentation or Blog the excellent mongodb data modeling book particularly relevant here because the patterns are one of the one of the coolest parts of this book I'll definitely take a look at that and with that I'm going to wrap up this tutorial and wish you a wonderful rest of your day thank you very much
