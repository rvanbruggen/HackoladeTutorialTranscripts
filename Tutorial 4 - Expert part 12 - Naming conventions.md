## Transcript of the video

hello everyone and welcome to another episode of our hackerlade tutorial in this episode we'll be talking about something that we've treated a number of times before uh being the functionality that we have in the hackerlade studio around naming conventions please do take a look at our documentation page which is extremely elaborate and very very detailed and also the really nice and short YouTube video that we've created as well for you but today we'll be treating this as a little bit of a tutorial right so we're going to be explaining some of the concepts to you and then at the end we'll also do a short demo right so let's take a look here um naming conventions you know this is something that we have had in our product for quite some time and it's the functionality where you can maintain both a business name and a technical name for your modeling objects right this is obviously the case because these business names allow you to have a much more user-friendly and understandable explanation of what it is that we're actually modeling with what it is that we actually mean with the data that we are trying to represent in our data models right technical names for example might use abbreviations or some kind of a case um alteration that might fit the technology needs right some technologies have a need for shorter naming or for a specific layout or whatever it might be and so therefore we try to facilitate this in our Accolade Studio by enabling these naming conventions right you don't have to use this this is clearly optional if you don't enable it then business names are going to be used as the technical names during our forward engineering steps right but you can using this functionality automate the synchronization of both these names based on parameters parameters and or an optional conversion file and we'll discuss this in a little more detail now so you have different options that you can apply here you can either disable this which is the default right or you can basically say the business name is going to be synchronized with the technical name or the technical name is going to be synchronized with the business name right so in the other direction when we do reverse engineering we assume that the physical Target that we are you know deriving the model from is already containing the technical names and that these would be transformed into business names so clearly you need to think this through then you need to think about the direction in which you want to synchronize your naming conventions but all of this is facilitated through our tools of course and you can configure these tools by going into the option dialogue of the hack lead studio so go to tools options and then naming conventions and to enable the naming conventions you simply have to change the default name coupling from node to business to technical this is the most common scenario obviously where you have a conversion going on from business names to technical names automatically the other direction from technical to business is very much more Uncommon and not often used but it's there for completeness and then you should realize that the rules of the naming conventions are executed in descending order in the options dialog so first we do the files conversion which we'll get to in a minute and then we do the vowel removal the invalid character removal and we also do the case conversion you should also understand that sometimes some of these rules interact right so if you have a space mentioned in the invalid characters then that will mean that there's going to be some impact on the case conversion because in the case conversion we sometimes use spaces to introduce underscores or whatever and that will obviously no longer work when spaces are removed and as we will show you later there is an optional conversion file that you can use right so it's a CSV file with three uh columns so the business name the technical name and the optional description where uh you can basically apply this to your specific business environment and have our tool understand how you want the business name and the technical name to be related to each other using this CSV file right so it's a really convenient way to handle for example domain specific or customer specific or application specific abbreviations and you can just use your favorite text editor or code editor or even a spreadsheet program to edit this file please also realize that the conversion file works at different levels right so we start with individual words but then also matches for combinations of individual words or combinations of different words in the files or phrases really um calculate first matches the phrases and then matches the individual Words which is a very powerful way of working and works with many longer phrases obviously there's a good example here you know it might mean that for example a customer and an account could get converted into a simple abbreviation but that the customer checking account and the customer account would get a different type of conversion depending on the entry in the file you should note that the conversion parameters that we have configured in the options pane are specific to each Target right this is logical right because some targets for example don't accept uppercase or other targets recommend a particular case or you know typically use a particular case right or have different invalid and invalid characters right so so the naming conventions are going to be specific to the Target that you're going to be working with and you will have to configure this in this options Pane and as we will show a little bit later you can actually export and import these configurations uh really really easily from our tool so every time that you change something to the configurations the tool is going to ask you you know would you like to apply this would you like to specifically make the changes make the naming configuration permanent to the names that are specifically coupled or to the entire model that we have in front of us and this is interesting right because that means that we have a manual way that we can say well these names are going to be coupled and these are not right this is something that you configure in the properties pane right this is where you can have three states for the relationship between your business and your technical name you can say you know they are independent of each other there is no relationship or you can say the business name is leading so you convert the business name to a technical name or alternatively and lastly you can say the technical name is leading and that means that the tool will convert the technical name to the business name right typically we would say you know you would organize your name coupling at the model level but as you can see here with the pressing or unpressing of the equal sign next to your properties you can do this as the individual level and that is why you have that option here in the applying changes dialog right where you can either apply it to the coupled names or to the entire model what's important is as well that you understand how the tool behaves during the reverse engineering process right if there is no coupling then all the business names or the object names of the source are going to be stored in the business name property right if there is either a business to technical or a technical to business coupling then the object names from the source are going to be stored in the technical name property right which is logical right what we read in the Target what we read in the reverse engineering Target is going to be your technical structure right and we will then convert this to the business name using the conversion parameter note that you also want to take some care here when you for example set the coupling to no that will for example clear all the technical names allow it allows you to uh maintain the business and the technical names on an individual basis right but um it will also potentially clear the technical names and you need to handle this with appropriate care so with that I propose that we uh switch to a short demonstration and uh try to explain some of these Concepts uh with the demo obviously there's a lot more material in the documentation online so let's take a look at this and give you a little bit of a taste of what these naming conventions look like in practice so I have my Accolade studio right here and I'm going to give you two scenarios one scenario where I will work with an existing model right and I will apply naming conventions to that existing model and another one where I will be reverse engineering a new model that doesn't exist yet and we will see how we can apply those naming confusions there so just to give you a little bit of a feel here right so you go into the options you see the naming conventions pane right there and you see that the naming conventions are specific to the application Target that I'm working with I'm also going to be working on business to technical name coupling right so these are the names that will you know tie the business names to the technical names they're the reverse is very much possible but it's much less used so we'll work with the business through technical coupling here and we'll be using a specific conversion file right which I can show you right here it's a very simple file structure where you have the business name the technical name and the optional description right you can see how the alignment happens in this CSV file I'm using visual studio code here to edit this but you can edit this in any text editor or a spreadsheet editor that you want to work with right but you see I have a couple of definitions here right so business name account will have a technical name called acct customer will be cust you see this right do so but I also have some more complex business names here like customer account will become CSC ACC and as explained previously you know this is a sequential set of rules that is being applied here starting with the individual words then with the phrases and then potentially with you know combinations of those as well right so let's go in here and also realize you know I have the the conversion file I'm going to be having some display options here I'm not going to remove vowels that's very often too completely confusing I have some invalid characters here but note that there are no spaces in here just to avoid confusion with some of the case conversion settings over here note that I can export these options right so the definitions of how my naming conversions work I can export them and so I can also import them so that everyone in your organization would be applying the same types of naming convention so let's go into a particular model here I'll work with this particular ODB model that I have over here and you see you know the business name has been filled in here but the technical names are not yet filled in so I can go into my options here and I can go to my naming conventions and say you know why don't you refresh this and then um it will ask me you know if I would like to apply these naming conventions to the coupled names only or to the entire model when I do this for the entire model you can already see that the ship name and has been converted into a technical name here the equal sign means that they are tied together right and I can no longer edit this right so if I want to click on this then all of a sudden I can edit this but that's not what I want in this particular situation so now that we have this first iteration of our naming conventions in place right where you see them right here popping up over here on the right hand side you will also realize that I can illustrate this even better by just quickly going through this manually here and adding another property right and I just want to quickly remind you that over here in my naming conventions file I have an account entry I have a customer so account gets modified into accd in the technical name you will also see that the customer gets translated into cust but that customer account gets translated into cstacc right remember that so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to add a property here to this orders collection right I'll do that right now and I'll actually show you how this naming convention gets activated in real time so if I do customer here you see it popping up it becomes cost past if I do account it becomes acct but if I do customer accounts it becomes csdacc right so this is exactly what I've got over here in my naming conventions conversion file and you can see it live while I type in the model over here now I can also undo this really really easily if I basically set this to and then say you want to apply this then it will ask me if I want to clear the technical names you can so that I can potentially correct some mistakes or whatever so but be careful with that right that you don't want to be making inadvertent changes there so this is the example of an individual model that we are editing here right so I'm not going to save this and I'm going to switch to a reverse engineering example right I'm just going to quickly check and make sure that the naming convention settings have been set already right because when I do the reverse engineering from the existing mongodb instance I want to make sure that it will actually create not just the technical names but also the business name so let's go in there and reverse engineer the target mongodb target from Atlas it's going to connect and I'm going to choose the right one do the inferencing of the relationships and when it does this then you see that it's going to ask me a question whether I want to reverse engineer The Source attributes as business names or as technical names right and you know depending on what I choose here there will be different Behavior the natural thing to do would be that the atlas instance actually contains the technical names right because that's what is being stored inside the database right it's not the business names that are stored it's a technical name so this is the more natural thing but you can choose both and now what's going to happen is the naming conventions that I have specified will actually be applied so that means that genres all of a sudden has a business name associated with it that is capitalized right same thing with the this technical name the inflix whatever it is right it's going to get capitalized right so all of these things are now applied um as we have specified them in our naming conventions right so this is another great example of how you can create these business names from an existing database using reverse engineering um so with that we're going to wrap up this tutorial on naming conventions I'd like to invite you to take some of the reading material on board the documentation our blog obviously the Fantastic book that we have published together with Steve hobermann and Daniel kupal about mongodb data modeling and schema design very very useful and then of course our socials and uh yeah why don't you try it yourself and download the hackolate studio for free with that I'm going to wrap up I thank you for your attention and I wish you a wonderful rest of your day
