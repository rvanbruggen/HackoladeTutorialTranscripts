## Unedited transcript of the video

hello everyone and welcome to part 11 of this high quality tutorial in this tutorial we're going to be talking about how you can use calculate and Accolade studio for creating a model for graph databases this is interesting not just because I have a long hidden history with graph databases but also because this is very specific to a particular type of nosql databases like for example neo4j my former employer but also Cosmos DB has a gremlin API Janus graph Neptune has a gremlin API and other thinker pop based nosql databases that are going to allow you to create these labeled property graph data stores so what are we talking about here well first of all we're talking about a special family of Nu SQL databases right whereas most uh no SQL databases are actually what we call aggregate stores right so they create some kind of Aggregates of um your data in the in in line with your access patterns right so a document format or a white column uh format or a key value store right something like that property graphs and labeled property graphs actually do something completely different right what they will do is they will create these Network structures where the relationships between the instances of entities right are actually an explicit part of your data model they refer to this as treating the relationships as a first-class citizens right so it allows you to basically see immediately without doing any kind of calculation without doing any kind of joining of data how things are connected to each other this is useful because it can reveal sometimes these hidden relationships between different entities hidden hidden in the sense of indirect relationships between entities that are important to particular types of use cases right so this is different from other databases right in relational databases you already have some kind of a concept of a relationship by having things like join tables right but you would still need to calculate the join at read time right so you would enter key information into the join table but you would still need to actually join things together at retime other data data source like these aggregate data stores would basically leave that up to the application right so you would either embed the relationships into an aggregate document structure of some sorts that has information about relationships inside the document or you would leave it up to the application to do the joining at read time so graph databases explicitly connect the data at right time so not you know at read time but at the right time so typically you know a higher right cost right so it takes more time to write something into a graph database but a very very fast read times because joins become very very simple this has a lot of use cases in things like fraud detection recommendation engines social networks path finding and Logistics you know all of these types of things are are actually really interesting use cases which is probably why I spend so much time working with them at the FJ having said that um this is not about me uh about property graph databases um what we're going to be looking at here is how you use nodes or sometimes also referred to as vertices as places where you can store your entities right so a person a car a uh vehicle a uh City you know whatever it is you know would be a Vertex right um and the relationships between those vertices uh are sometimes also referred to as edges right when they represent the individual links between specific instances of these entities right properties on both nodes and relationships allow you to qualify these do you so you can say something about the node about the person by giving it a name property a name attribute same thing with relationships and this is actually quite significant and differentiating you can qualify a relationship you can say something about a relationship by assigning a property to it so Rick is married to Kathleen okay the married two relationship you can qualify that by saying you know the date of the marriage for example or since date something like that right so you can say something about both the nodes and the Relationships by assigning properties to qualify them you also have these special types of properties for nodes we call these labels right labels are specific types of properties that group nodes together in subgraphs right so these are all my persons these are all my cities these are all my uh cars whatever it might be right so you're you're assigning a special type of property called a label to do that so these things are special because labels will oftentimes be used for things like uh assigning security privileges or assigning indexing capabilities or those types of things and the same thing applies to um a relationship a relationship has a type right which is a special type of property which categorizes the relationship they're a little bit different depending on the implementation um I would like to add that these property graphs are and graphs in general are visually quite attractive and this is some thing why many people are attracted to graph databases because it's so easy and so so intuitive to reason about but of course we can also and this is what we'll do in hacker lathe we can actually also represent this as a entity relationship diagram right where we simply put you know the nodes can be can become the blue boxes and the relationships can become the uh black boxes that you see on this ERD and so very easy um I will show you in the in the demo a little bit later on how you can create these graph models right by basically diagramming it in hyperlade right very very simple to use and then of course we have a couple of specific toolbar functions that will allow you to lay out these diagrams to display them in a certain way you know the label names the attribute boxes and lots of different controls that are available for doing this type of modeling and of course you know there's very interesting capabilities like with all of the Accolade models to integrate this into a bigger modeling effort by using things like polyglot data models or by using things like external references or reusable attributes you know all of this is is available as well for property grouse having said that you know there are quite a few differences between the capabilities of the different property graph implementations right so some of them actually have some kind of a schema Associated to them some of them have no schema and and as a consequence you know the forward engineering capabilities of hackerlade are going to be quite different dependent on your choice of property graph implementation right so you will have to investigate that and and read up on that so that you know exactly what to expect for every single one of your plugins and Target architectures that you're going to be choosing right so lots of documentation available please note that there's actually really great neo4j data modeling book that was published by the same publisher that published the mongodb data modeling and schema design book that Pascal demare of hackerelitco authored you will find that in the neo4j book authored by Dave Foss and Steve hoberman um there's also ex you know elaborate use of hackolate illustrations so I would highly recommend that you take a look at that now with that I'm going to quickly switch to a short demo and hopefully that will wrap up this tutorial so here we are in our hacklight studio and I'm going to create a new model I'm going to select neo4j for this last version of neo4j and then I can basically start over here and say okay let me add a new database right the tutorial database and then inside that database I'm going to add a node um in that node I'm going to say this is the person right and then I'm going to add another node label right and I'm going to call this the city right I can add attributes to these nodes you know by for example clicking over here and saying okay I want you to have a property key that property key is going to be a string that's going to be in an ID first and then I'm going to add one more and which is the name of that person and then I'm going to add an ID to the city as well and say you know this is also it has a name right and then I can say okay these two things are related to each other so let's add a relationship to that and this relationship is going to be the lives in relationship right and then I can say okay this lives in relationship actually has a property right so and I will add the property to that relationship right here so I'm going to say okay this one has oh sorry I'm going to add a property key here and that is going to be a temporal data type right and that temporal data type is of a subtype date so that we know since when uh Rick has been living or someone has been living in that particular city right so now you see that over here right it has a since property over there so this is how we can do this from scratch but I would also like to show you how you can um work with this by doing reverse engineering right so if I now reverse engineer a particular neo4j targets right I can say okay here is my neo4j instance I have a uh Aura database that has been pre-set up I can read the instance of the neo4j aura database and it will basically immediately show you show me what the uh the data model looks like right so this is a database of the Women's World Cup I think it was 2019 that we created that at the time so here you see okay this has a number of properties this probably also has some properties you know so we can see how that is being done the cipher as is also generated and you will see that because neo4j doesn't have many of the schema capabilities that you are used to from other data stores it doesn't have all of the ddl or or schema specifics that you might be used to it uses a lot of examples here to that you'll see in Cypher but it also allows you to create constraints and stuff like that automatically by working with the plugin that we provide for neo4j right so lots of other capabilities here maybe a couple more things that I can highlight here at the top you have a uh Force directed layout capability right so this allows you to visualize where where things are going to be positioned you can pin certain parts of the graph to a particular location and then the other elements will follow you can also select you know what you want to choose what you want to see inside the visualization right so do you want to see the relationship names yes or no or do you want to see The Entity boxes you know you can see you can select those things from the menu here great with that I'm going to wrap up this part of our tutorial I hope this was useful and I wish you a wonderful rest of your day have a good one
