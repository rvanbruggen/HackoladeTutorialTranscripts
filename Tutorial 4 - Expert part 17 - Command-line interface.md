## Transcript of the video

hello everyone and welcome to another Accolade how-to video today I'm going to show you how you can use the Accolade command line interface to automate some of your most common tasks in your data modeling workflows right so there's a lot of different things that you can do with the command line interface and today I'm going to actually show you how you can actually reverse engineer the data model from a particular Target right so what I want to show you here first is doing it using the tool using the Accolade visual tool where I'm going to point it to a postgres database I'm going to say okay using this particular connection Accolade local postgres please import the DVD rental database right not just import it I actually just all I want to do is inspect it and derive the schema for it this takes a couple of seconds so I'm going to come back to it in uh when it's finished and show you what the model will look like here we go the process has finished and now I have my Accolade data model already right it's got the films got the actors got the languages all of this is available in this data model was reverse engineered I'm going to call this the manual model right I'm going to save that in my CLI directory uh we go and then I will show you as well how you can actually do this differently by using the command line interface right so in order to do that I'm going to switch to my terminal right and I'm in the terminal I'm going to paste a particular command right a particular command that says accolade refng right reverse engineer from a Target called postgres SQL right to a particular file the CLI model.json file using a connection that was already existing right I actually use that in the tool base or user interface based process as well or Accolade local postgres and I'm going to reverse engineer a particular database key schema for the DVD rentals I start this I launch the command and again this is going to take a few seconds so I'll come back to you once the process has finished here we go the model has been saved so if I now take a look here this is where I originally had my manual model.json and now I also have the CLI model.json I'm going to try and open that I'll open the model in my user interface right so it's a CLI model.json right it should be exactly the same as what I had before right so it's got the same entities it's got the films it's got the languages the actors exactly the same thing and I can actually do this automatically Now using the command line interface as many times as I want this allows me to automate my pipelines and make sure that I have an accurate view of the latest state of my schema of my data model as it is existing in the database that wraps up this little video I'm going to come back to some other CLI functionalities in other videos but for now I'm going to wish you a wonderful day and thank you for watching hello everyone and welcome to another Accolade how-to video in this video I'm actually going to do a sequel to the previous video um that was all about how we can use the Accolade command line interface to reverse engineer a data model from a particular Target in that case a particular postgres database right by using that system we actually ended up with two data models right we had one that we created manually and the other one that we created through the CLI now let me open up the CLI version of it because I've actually made a small change to that data model I've removed the language entity from the film over here right which basically is a change of fundamental change to the data model that we you know may or may not be able to detect automatically right what I'm going to do now is I'm actually going to do a comparison of the two male models the left model will be my um manually created model which I created with the tool and the right hand model will be the one that I created with the CLI and which I adapted afterwards right and removed the language entity from right and I should actually add here that the order of these two models left or right is very important right because if you put one model or the other model to the left you know or vice versa you would actually get very different Delta models and very different operations to go from one model to the other the difference between the models would either be a creation or a deletion right depending on the order of these two models so but let me do that manually here I'm going to compare it it does detect that there has been a change in the language entity and what I can do with accolades I can generate this Delta model right which I'm going to do here as well so it's the CLI model Delta that I'm going to create right I'm going to do this as a Json document right and it's going to be it's going to be generating that Delta model for me and I can then immediately he opened that and take a look at that over here in my Accolade client and then you will see exactly what it is right the language has been deleted right language entity has been deleted and I can then also look at the postgres ddl alter script that has been generated by the client so that I can then if I wanted to automatically execute that in my postgres Management console now the interesting thing here is that I can also do that exact operation just like I did it today in the hackerlade studio client I can also do that in my command line interface that's exactly what I'd like to show you now I'm going to switch to that command line interface and show you how I can execute a few commands and then do exactly the same operation so let me then find my terminal and then I'm going to paste the script right so this is exactly the same command but instead of doing reverse engineering it do it's doing a comp model basically a comparison between the manual model and the CLI model that I have in my directory and it's going to generate the Delta model dot Json file for me right so again this is exactly the same thing as what I was doing with the tool visually but now through a script right something that I can put into a pipeline something that I can trigger automatically and now all I need to do is go back to my tool open the model to open the Delta model that's this one over here right and you will see that it contains exactly the same thing right there's a language deletion here and we've also generated the ddl script right so that's it I wanted to show you that and I hope that it was useful this was the Second Step of our CLI video how to's where we showed you how you can take the reverse engineered model from before and do a model comparison and do that also automatically using the CLI I hope that this was useful and I wish you a wonderful day hello everyone and this is uh another episode of our Accolade how-to videos uh this is going to be a very short one following up on the previous uh video that we did around using the command line interface the CLI to compare models and generate a Delta model I have that Delta model right here right and as you can tell this Delta model was identifying the fact that an entity had been deleted specifically the language entity had been deleted there's a post script ddl script that was generated inside the tool but what I want to show you now is that you can do exactly the same thing in our command line right so what I'm doing here is I'm pasting a um a little command here which is the Hackle Lake Mainline interface that will forward engineer this Delta model that I have generated already into a script right it's going to create a script for me and this script is going to be exactly what I need to automatically update my data model or my data database schema rather using a an automated process so let me go into my directory here you see that there's a new directory called Delta model.script right and when I open that it will show me that there is a new DOT SQL script that drops the table if it exists and this is exactly what I was hoping great that's what I wanted to show you you can not only reverse engineer using the CLI not only compare models using the CLI but you can also generate the scripts that you want in order to manage the schemas on your database I hope that this was useful and I wish you a wonderful day hello everyone and welcome to another Accolade how-to video this is going to be another short video where we explained how you can use the command line interface to generate documentation automatically for your data models using the command line interface this is something that you can do very very easily using the tool also obviously if I open up a data model right at the top here I will have a a particular menu item that allows me to generate the documentation right and if I do that then after a few seconds it will come back with the HTML PDF or markdown documentation right but also I can do this automatically by just feeding a simple command to my terminal here so this one here is the hackerlade Gen doc document Command right and I'm going to first generate HTML right and then we'll take it from there right so that's the first one that I'm going to take and that should only take a few seconds and it should come back with the directory fully generated note that this HTML version of the documentation is actually quite smart it includes all of the uh visuals all of the graphics immediately there now let me do the same thing with the PDF format right so I'm going to generate that as well and last and but not least I will do the markdown generation as well and then show you what it looks like once that is all finished right so it's a very very simple set of commands that you can generate here and again the same principle applies to as to all of the command line interface commands you can very very easily integrate this into a script or a GitHub action or whatever it is that you want to use it for so here we're launching the markdown version so they're just showing this so right here right so we've got the documentation directory right here the PDF is already there right the HTML is already there right and in a few seconds we will get the markdown also to be generated the markdown is also really interesting because it includes a separate directory with all of the um GIF files right so PNG files I should rather right so all of these things are automatically put into a separate directory so that you can also use them for other purposes where necessary so again everything that we were able to do in the client interface of Accolade we're also able to do as part of the command line interface and as a consequence we can embed that into all of our processes into all of our pipelines and automate some of our data modeling tasks using this command line interface I hope this was useful and I look forward to hearing from you and I wish you a wonderful day cheers hello everyone and welcome to another Accolade how-to video in this video I'm going to try and tie together the different aspects of our command line interface that I have them demonstrated in previous videos what I'm going to do here is to I'm going to try and create a very simple way that will show you how you can use the command line interface to automate automate some of your workflows what have I done I've basically created a new uh little document over here which is a script a shell script and you have the same thing on Windows or other platforms you know a batch file or whatever you want to call it that will automate the execution of all of the different steps that we had in our previous videos right so first of all we're going to reverse engineer a postgres SQL database then secondly we're going to compare that model that we have generated from the reverse engineering with a previous previously generated model and then here we're going to create the ddl script and finally generate the documentation this is a very simple shell script I am not a bash programmer as you will see but still this thing can and will be called from for example a GitHub action or some other trigger and it will basically do everything that we want it to do right so first step here we're going to reverse engineer a postgres SQL database into a calculated data model I'm going to pause the recording here for a second and here we are we've gone to the next step already the reverse engineering has completed and it has saved the model uh into the directory and it's already started the second phase right it's uh compared that model to the previous model and it's also already started the third step which is it's generating the ddl script for my comparison model and the fourth step has already started as well it is generating the different uh PDF HTML and markdown documentation artifacts PDF is you know what it is it's a PDF document the HTML document is super interesting because it includes all of the graphics into one comprehensive document and the markdown is interesting because it will have all of the graphics put into a separate folder where all the pngs are there for you to use and integrate it to other systems right so this is all going completely automatically you know in one simple shell script Nothing that you have to do in order to uh to trigger this you know you can call this from wherever and as you will see here you know the directory is already here right so I've got the the documentation directory filling up nicely so this is how you can work with a simple shell script to automate your pipelines um much more sophistication is possible there but I hope that this was already useful and that you will enjoy this using this in your workflows I wish you a wonderful day
