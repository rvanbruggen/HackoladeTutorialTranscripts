## Unedited transcript of the video

hello everyone and welcome to another episode of our Accolade tutorial in this episode I'll be talking to you about how you can use the Excel template as a mechanism to export and import data in and out of your data model Excel obviously is a really powerful tool and you definitely can do many many different things with it and you know we would like to explain to you how that works in the context of the Accolade studio right so it allows you to basically exchange data between an Excel file right a pre-formatted specific template of an Excel file and the Accolade Studio data models right so this allows you to basically export your data model into Excel do a bunch of easy editing of popular properties in the Excel format in the tabular format of Excel and then save that Excel file and re-import that back into your hackolate studio data model right so the great thing about that is that um while you obviously lose some functionality T and you're not looking at the data model in the way that you can do this in the Accolade Studio it does allow for some types of interactions and actions that are more productively done in Excel like bulk updates or maintenance of properties or editing of colors or those types of things you know things that you would require would be required to do a lot of different clicks inside the Accolade Studio or edits in the Highlight Studio well they can very easily be done in Excel so you can create a model in Excel right and add containers and entities attributes or whatever or you can edit an existing model right you can work from an existing model right which will demonstrate to you a little bit later on then you can basically select all the properties and you know do whatever you need to do there add custom attributes if necessary and do basically these large updates to your data model really really easily in the Excel file right there are some limitations right these are very important references references to definitions are not resolved right and you need to take care about the version of the template that you're using as they must be the same as the Target and the plugin version of the export process okay so the way to get going with this is you go into the tools menu of your Accolade studio right so you have a model open already and you basically say well I want to go tools forward engineer this particular model to an Excel file and it will pop up a dialog that will ask you to select the objects that you want to have exported into Excel right you may want to reduce the list of objects that you want to have exported right you can influence that over here also you can select Which object properties you want to have exported inside the Excel file right maybe you don't need all of them maybe you're only manipulating some of them inside Excel so you can use this dialog to reduce the number of columns that you want to have exported because you don't need them inside the Excel file and then finally I'd like to mention that you can also maintain these options these export options in the general forward engineering options of your hackerlade studio right so if you go into the general General options pane you will also find that there's a forward engineering piece there and there you can basically say well for every Target for every application Target I want to have these types of options that I'm going to share with my colleagues right so you can explain these options or import these options from someone else's configuration really really easily that means that you can basically do the same thing in the other direction right when I go reverse engineering right tools reverse engineer Excel templates then you know it's going to use those same options to import the information into your data model we always assume that you have first done the forward engineering from your existing model even if you're creating a new model then you forward engineer an empty model first and then you edit that in Excel and re-import IT back you really need to take care about the titles and the Order of the columns inside your Excel file because this is a template this should not be altered right and what you should also really uh clearly understand is that Excel is not as rich or as powerful as the Highlight Studio clients it has some significant limitations like for example the fact that we cannot enforce referential Integrity between the worksheets right so if you add something in one worksheet then the other worksheet doesn't necessarily know about it you really need to make sure that this is uh kept in mind and also if you're working with CSV files right when you're for example importing a CSV file into the Hackley Studio then you first can Implement implement this and import this by doing using the Excel template as an intermediary so there are some very specific ways of doing this and there's an expected Behavior right which is all centered around how we can match or update or insert the different data elements based on the their uids based on their unique identifiers right so if we we find those uuids and it's really easy right we match them and we can work with those if they're not there then we will create or insert those properties or those attributes in your data model A really interesting feature of the Excel template is the fact that it supports dot notation which means that you can also include complex structures complex data types inside the tabular format of excel because you know the dot notation will tell it you know how the different parts of a particular element are hierarchically structured we support lots of different data types there as well so really really powerful and we should also stress that the import process the reverse engineering process from an Excel file to a highlight data model has some very significant validations included right you can list them here and you know please experiment with them as well but our assumption is that any input any reverse engineering that you do from an Excel file should never corrupt your model right so it should always lead to a sound result and we highly recommend that you test this beforehand and make sure that you always have backups or versions version controls set up so that you can always go back if necessary right so the Excel import export capability is really best suited for bulk editing of existing models right it's not intended for creating new models right because you know when you create a new model there's lots of logic involved and this logic is not present inside that template and you know when you do that when you do these bulk updates please also realize that you know there are some limitations right and that you probably want to start small validate the approach and then iterate over that and you know gradually and progressively try more elaborate scenarios so with that I'm going to switch to the Highlight studio and show you how to use this so here we go we have our mongodb model here which I've used in a number of occasions over here right with the movies and the comments and all of those different capabilities reverse engineered from a sample data set on mongodb Atlas and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to forward engineer this into an Excel file right so I have my options over here that I can select you know what needs to be included you just going to grab everything now submit that and then it's going to ask me okay where do you want to store this Excel file well I'm going to replace an older version of the Excel file that I already had and then I'm going to show you what the result is right it's right here now so let's open this up a little bit right so in this Excel file which was generated from my data model I have some guidelines I have application info right I have the model info database info all of the things that you know are in my model here right so sample inflix that's right what I see over here that's the name of the database right and then if I go into the collections right so I have the list of collections here comments movies sessions theaters and users I have all the fields right all the list of fields that are over here belonging to a particular entity with all of their characteristics right not all of them are filled in obviously but it's quite a long list of potential things that I can change here and I have a number of other optional optional worksheets here that I can run through now what I'd like to do is I'd like to show you how you can do two things really really easily right so first thing I'm going to do is for my collections I'm going to modify the color of these um these uh entities right so the color is over here right now let me just grab a different color that I have over here right and that is going to be an orange like color you will see it in a couple of minutes right so let's save that right so we by doing this by editing this in the collection tab all of the collections that I have inside my data model later on are going to show up differently they're going to have a different color obviously but I'd like to do something additional right so a little bit more on the content side of things right so I have a name and I have an entity name right for all of my attributes why don't I use an Excel formula which is going to say well this is a field named and then I'm going to ref refer to this right and then continue for entity called and I can say this right so this is what would be added automatically to my description field so I'm going to copy that over there right so you see how that works using formulas I have automatically updated all of these descriptions I'm going to save this now and the Excel file has now been updated and I'm going to go back here to my model and see if I can easily re-import that right so how do I do that I go into my reverse engineering and say I want to reverse engineer from an Excel template that I've just saved over here right and it's going to warn me it's going to say well hey you know if you already have values in your open model we will be overwriting them right so do you really want to proceed right and then it's going to do all kinds of validations remember we don't want to be corrupting any files right and then it will say successfully imported even giving you a log file of what exactly has happened right so now I go back to my model hey look at this the color has changed right I've updated these in build rather than having to go into every entity here and then you know choosing the options here and all that type of stuff right I just do this in bulk in my in my Excel template and then over here if I go and I look at the description look at that this has automatically been updated as well right so reverse engineering from that Excel file has performed a significant large update to my data model without really having to do too much work by using some of the automation capabilities in Excel we can actually do this um uh and and have this happen inside our Accolade model as well right there's obviously so many more powerful things that you can do now right because inside Excel you can do scripting you can do database connectivity you know you can do whatever it is that you want to do inside Excel and use the template to bring that back into your data models so with that I'm going to wrap up this tutorial and hopefully this was a useful one for you and you will see that there's a ton of additional reading material as always and I look forward to hearing your feedback in any case I wish you a wonderful rest of your day bye
